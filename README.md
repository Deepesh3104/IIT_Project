## Introduction

Insurance fraud is a significant problem in the industry, leading to financial losses and higher premiums for honest customers. This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to build a predictive model that can identify potential fraudulent insurance claims with high accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Flask==2.3.2 or Flask==1.1.2
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- pandas==1.5.1
- Python 3.10.11

Ensure that you have these versions of the required packages installed to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IITBhilai/Insurance_Fraud_Detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
$ cd Insurance_Fraud_Detection
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

## Usage

To use the insurance fraud detection system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have installed all the required dependencies as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

2. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

3. The application will start, and you can interact with it via the provided interface.

4. Input the necessary data for the insurance claim you want to evaluate.

5. The Machine Learning model will process the data and predict the likelihood of fraud for the given claim.
